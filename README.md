# Linux SMTP Client with Postfix
Setting postfix as a SMTP client (relay) using external server for mail sending from linux system.


- Your crontab doesn't send you mails?
- Want your bash script to send mails without setting up SMTP stuff for each one?
- Want send external mails without being marked as SPAM?
#### Maybe that can fix it for you!

This script sets some parameters on the linux system, so many email user agents (MUAs) can correctly deliver email using an external SMTP server using Postfix.




#### Future plans:
- Configure ~/.mailrc file;
- Configure /etc/mail.rc file;
- Configure exim4;
- Configure msmtp.
- Tell me you... Any improvements are welcome.
